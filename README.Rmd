Amanda 
```{r}
library("classdata")
ames
```
there are 16 variables in the ames data set. the majority of the variables are characters. there are some variables that are dates or years, and there are also some numberical variables.


2. some variabes of special interest would be sale price

*Question 4: Luke*
```{r}
load(classdata)
max(ames$`LotArea(sf)`, na.rm = TRUE)
min(ames$`LotArea(sf)`, na.rm = TRUE)

ggplot(ames, aes(x = 'LotArea(sf)')) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "lightblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of LotArea", x = "LotArea", y = "Frequency")


```

I pick FinishedBsmtArea (sf).Range is 523228.

Follow the instructions posted at https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html for the lab assignment. The work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file to your repository.  

```{r}
head(ames)
str(ames)
```


Jackson picked TotalLivingArea (sf)

```{r}
Range_TotalLivingArea <- range(ames$`TotalLivingArea (sf)`, na.rm = TRUE)
print(Range_TotalLivingArea)

ggplot(data = ames) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = `TotalLivingArea (sf)`, y = `Sale Price`, )) 

TotalLivingArea_extremeSlopeChange <- subset(ames, `TotalLivingArea (sf)` >= 1000 & `TotalLivingArea (sf)` <= 2000)

ggplot(data = TotalLivingArea_extremeSlopeChange ) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = `TotalLivingArea (sf)`, y = `Sale Price`, )) 

```
The graph above tells me that the price per total living area in ft.^2 is higher around 0 - 1200, then after that the sales price goes down dramatically. Then the sales price flattens out around 2500 - 5000; then it starts to go back up again. The sales price per ft.^2 at the beginning is very high, its at its highest at around 750 ft.^2, then it has a dramatic drop around 1200 - 1500. This tells me there is a starting cost of a building that is automatically built into it or the supply and demand is very high, I would need more data to figure that out. The total living area from 1000 - 2000 sales price doesn't reach near a constant, it's constantly changing.  

Brennan picked Style (sf)
```{r}
library(dplyr)

ames <- ames %>%
  mutate(Price_Range = cut(`Sale Price`,
                           breaks = c(0, 50000, 100000, 150000, 200000, 300000, 400000, 500000, Inf),
                           labels = c("0-50k", "50k-100k", "100k-150k", "150k-200k", "200k-300k", "300k-400k", "400k-500k", "500k+"),
                           include.lowest = TRUE,
                           ordered_result = TRUE))
ames <- ames %>%
  filter(!is.na(Style) & Style != "None")

ggplot(ames, aes(x = Style, fill = Price_Range)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack", color = "black") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(y = "Number of Houses Sold", x = "Type of House", fill = "Sale Price Range")
